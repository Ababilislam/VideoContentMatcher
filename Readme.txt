Task 1:
##################
This script utilizes the Moviepy library to perform audio detachment and sound removal from video clips.
It loads video files, extracts audio, and writes the audio to separate audio files. and store it.

##################
Task 2:
##################
Importing Libraries:
The code starts by importing necessary libraries like numpy, libros, correlate from scipy. signal, and cosine from scipy.spatial.distance.
 These libraries will be used for audio processing and similarity calculations.

Defining preprocess_audio Function:
This function takes an audio file path and preprocesses it for similarity analysis.
It loads the audio file using librosa, computes the mel spectrogram, converts it to a dB scale, and limits it to a specified number of frames.

Defining calculate_waveform_similarity Function:
This function calculates the waveform similarity between two audio waveforms using cross-correlation.
It computes the correlation between the two waveforms and then normalizes the result to a range between 0 and 1.

Defining calculate_spectral_similarity Function:
This function calculates the spectral similarity between two mel spectrogram representations of audio clips.
It uses cosine similarity to measure how similar the two spectrum's are.

Defining calculate_similarity_percentage Function:
This function calculates the similarity as a percentage based on the provided similarity value and a given threshold.
This can be used to represent the similarity score in a more interpretable manner.

Loading and Preprocessing Audio Clips:
The code loads and preprocesses two audio clips (audio_1 and audio_2) using the preprocess_audio function.
It calculates the waveform and mel spectrogram for each audio clip.

Calculating Similarity Metrics:
The code calculates the waveform similarity using the calculate_waveform_similarity function and the spectral similarity using the calculate_spectral_similarity function.

Setting Similarity Thresholds:
Two similarity thresholds (waveform_similarity_threshold and spectral_similarity_threshold) are defined to determine whether the audio clips are considered similar or not.

Comparing Similarities:
The code then compares the spectral similarity with the spectral similarity threshold.
If the spectral similarity is higher than the threshold, it prints that the audio files are similar.

Printing Results:
The code prints out whether the audio files are similar or not based on the comparison made earlier.

In summary, this code processes two audio clips by calculating both waveform and spectral similarities.
It then compares the spectral similarity with a threshold to determine if the audio clips are similar.
The code aims to identify similarities between the audio clips based on their acoustic characteristics.

Note
#########################
Working with audio is really hard thing what i have done may not work for a audio with noise or other adulteration in the audio then we may need much more sophisticated way to do the similarity check.
Creating a perfect matcher needs to do much more work.

task3 :Video matching
#######################
The code you provided performs template matching between a main video and a template video using the OpenCV library in Python. Template matching is a technique used to find a sub-image (template) within a larger image (main image). The code iterates through the frames of the main video and checks if the template video matches any part of the current main frame.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

Importing OpenCV:
The code starts by importing the cv2 module from OpenCV, which provides functions for computer vision tasks.

Loading Videos:
The main video and template video are loaded using the cv2.VideoCapture function.

Reading the Template Frame:
The first frame of the template video is read using the .read() method. This frame will be used as the template for comparison.

Getting Template Dimensions:
The dimensions (width and height) of the template frame are extracted using .shape.

Initializing Parameters:
The code sets the step size for sliding the template over the main video frames, initializes counters for total frames and matched frames, and sets a similarity threshold.

Main Loop - Template Matching:
The code enters a loop that iterates through the frames of the main video. It reads each main frame using .read(). If there are no more frames, the loop exits.

Resizing Main Frame:
The main frame is resized to the dimensions of the template frame using cv2.resize. This resized frame will be used for template matching.

Template Matching:
Template matching is performed using the cv2.matchTemplate function. It computes a similarity map between the resized main frame and the template frame. The matching method used is cv2.TM_CCOEFF_NORMED.

Finding Maximum Similarity:
The code finds the location of the maximum similarity score using cv2.minMaxLoc. If the maximum similarity score exceeds the specified threshold, a match is found.

Drawing Rectangle on Match:
If a match is found, a green rectangle is drawn around the matched region using cv2.rectangle.

Displaying Frames:
The main frame with template matches is displayed using cv2.imshow. The code also checks for the Esc key (ASCII code 27) to break out of the loop if the user presses Esc.

Releasing Resources:
After the loop, the main video and template video are released using .release(). The OpenCV window is closed using cv2.destroyAllWindows().

Calculating and Displaying Accuracy:
The accuracy of template matching is calculated as the ratio of matched frames to total frames. It's then displayed as a percentage.

In summary, this code performs template matching between a main video and a template/cut_part video, identifies regions in the main video that match the template/cut_part, draws rectangles around the matched regions, and calculates the accuracy of the matching process.
The accuracy reflects how well the template/cut_part appears in the main video frames.

Dear i have the fundational understanding of python but not having much time i can't try to write the django code if i have more time then i can go for django.

I can guarantee you that if you select me as a trainee i can give you my word that you won't regret giving me the opportunity.
Thank you for you time.
